    Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help
    programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[29]
    <!--Here we have used paragraph tag and we can see the changes-->
    <p>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. </p>
    <p>It supports multiple programming paradigms, including</p>
    <p>structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented </p>
    <p> and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[30]</p>
